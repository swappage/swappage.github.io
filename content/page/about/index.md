Hello Everyone! My name is Francesco, aka Swappage.

Welcome to my blog! where technology often plays the funniest prank and running is an excuse to push limits (and laugh at ourselves). Get ready to dive into the adventures of a hacker and a perpetually clumsy runner, where glitchy bytes and missteps are everyday occurrences.
From cyber antics to unfortunate marathons, here we share it all, from our cybersecurity research to tales of the latest races - all with a healthy dose of humor and self-deprecation.

Ready for a run through the lines of code and the streets of life? Power up your devices and lace up your shoes, because we're ready to stumble through technology and race toward the unknown!

Ok. no.. seriously, I still have no idea on what i'll be posting on this blog, but for some odd reasons i decided i wanted to start writing about something, so it can really be anything.
Don't expect anything being published on a regular basis, there is absolutely no schedule.
Consider this more like a.. diary? of what happens in my daily life.
