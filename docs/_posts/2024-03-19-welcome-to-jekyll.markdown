Hello reader and welcome to this little corner of the interwebz where from time to time you might find some new content that I thought it was worth sharing with everyone willing to read.

How this idea of starting a blog came to my mind in the first place?
To be honest i still don't really know, truth is that, at this very address, I used to have a small blog which back in the days served as a repository for CTF writeups.

Probably due to an email from Github that I recently received, I remembered of that blog and the crazy idea blinked into my mind to start over.

I felt like i wanted to start writing again, but since what once was an hobby is now my daily job, I decuded to completely change the approach: and this is the reason why I'll be running this blog more as a diary or a place where I simply share my thoughts, experiments and experiences.

Most of the posts here will most likely be futile in terms of content, but I'll still try my best in writing something that, hopefully, will entertain at least some of the readers.

For sure, writing about my daily shenanigans will be entertaining for me: and for now, that's going to be enaugh.

See you soon in the next episode where there will be some proper content.
